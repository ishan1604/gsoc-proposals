GOOGLE SUMMER OF CODE 2017

**Implementing R****ole-based permissions in Mifos Android Client App**

**Abstract**

Android client for Mifos X allows the bank staff to manage the client details and records at any time remotely with both offline and online support. Mifos has already released the documentation having set of APIs needed to finish the app and I propose to implement a role-based permissions feature which will add up a layer of security to the transactions made by field agents for the clients and will help in authorized activation of different services.

**Problem Statement****   **

Financial security and fraud prevention are of utmost importance for any company. The process of creating a loan, client and transaction entry by the field agents is not supervised. Agents have unrestricted access to modify data and sensitive information which is a potential vulnerability. Due to lack of tracking, identification, and verification, there are chances of internal and external frauds which could lead to monetary losses.

**Proposed Solution**** **

The proposed implementation will enable role-based permissions in the application and will help in having a verification by higher authorities for all the critical transactions. This will enable multiple Officers in the organization having different roles, that will be validating documents for clients, loans, saving accounts, groups, centers before approval.

**Benefits**

For the organization, it will introduce an additional level of verification for documents before accessing bank utilities for activating any service for the client.

For the clients, it is ensuring that the loan has been sanctioned after proper verification which ensures a good level of security. This will reduce the chances of fraudulent cases or human error by the field agent.

**Project Goals**** **

These are the goals of the project which would help reduce the risk of fraudulent activities and errors.

* Role-based permissions - At first, role-based permissions need to be implemented for the existing modules and new proposed modules for the client, loan, saving account, group and center.

* Activation, updating, deletion, rejection, reactivation, the closing of a client should be implemented.

* Assigning and unassigning staff to a client need to be implemented.

* Loan Approve, reject, withdraw, rescheduling request, rescheduling approval, and rejection should be implemented.

* Saving account approval, rejection, withdrawal of request and closing of an account will be implemented as new modules.

* Group activation, updating, deletion, closing needs to be implemented.

* Center activation, updating, deletion, closing needs to be implemented.

**Project Timeline** **Official Coding Period**

GSOC officially provides 12 weeks to code and work on the project. In every 2 weeks, I will get mentors feedback on the code quality and design architecture as well as on UI/UX. In all the new and existing modules I will work with service interfaces, data-tables, model & presenter classes to implement role-based permissions wherever itâ€™s needed and end API calls for some specific features. Writing documentation and testing with mock data-table providers will be a necessary activity in each week.

**About Me**

* **Why are you the right person for this project:**

Last year, I pursued my summer internship from Elanic, Bangalore and there I learned the Implementation of Model-View-Presenter architecture, I worked on an Application that helped in automation of order status updating and checking order details, I implemented a custom barcode scanner and used RxJava and RxAndroid for implementation of it.

Here is the link for RxJava Implementation -

* **Career Goals:**

I am seeking to start a company on my own and contribute to the community.I aspire to work with a collaborative team of talented individuals and produce work that can functionally and potentially serve the needs of the clients.Taking a step forward, I recently took an initiative and started a developing club, to guide the students on how to get exposure to real-world projects and experience of working with the team on big projects.Completing that as my near term goal, I will prepare myself to take on expanded roles and responsibilities in the future.

* **Please share any links to source codes you have written or websites you have built:**

I have developed apps for some real world problems that are live on play store. I have made a lot of my projects open source to guide my juniors and classmates about the way I learn and implement.
